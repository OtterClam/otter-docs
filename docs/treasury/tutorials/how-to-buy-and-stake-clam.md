# How to buy and stake CLAM

## What is CLAM? <a href="#what-is-clam" id="what-is-clam"></a>

CLAM is a Polygon-based token that supports the entire OtterClam ecosystem. From staking and bonding mechanisms, to governance and PAW Market purchases, CLAM is the de facto currency behind every transaction in the Otter Kingdom.

The Polygon network is a layer 2 solution for the Ethereum blockchain. Although Polygon was created to alleviate traffic from the Ethereum network and allow smooth interactions between the two blockchains, it's naive token, MATIC, is now considered to be so unique that it no longer meets the ERC-20 standard.&#x20;

Since CLAM is built on Polygon, you'll need to acquire some $MATIC first.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to buy CLAM from exchanges or other chains.

### From Exchanges <a href="#from-exchanges" id="from-exchanges"></a>

There are many exchanges support Polygon withdrawal. Here is a list:

5. Withdraw MATIC from the exchange you use for your wallet. The wallet address should be the same as the one you have for Ethereum.
6. Swap some $MATIC to **$CLAM**. Attention: Don’t swap all! You should save some $MATIC for future gas fees, 0.1\~1 $MATIC is enough for plenty of transactions.
7. Go to OtterClam webapp [https://app.otterclam.finance/#/stake](https://app.otterclam.finance/#/stake)
8. Approve & Stake all your **$CLAM**s.
9. Sit and chill.\

_Note: Your fresh stake CLAM will be in warmup for 2 epochs. **$CLAM** in warmup still earns rebase rewards but you can’t unstake it. After 2 epochs, you can claim your warmup and get sCLAM in your wallet._
