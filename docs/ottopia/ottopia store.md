# Ottopia

Otto is the first official citizen of the Otter Kingdom. Each Otto is an ERC721 NFT with unique traits and attributes. These NFTs are not only irresistibly cute, but they also happen to be the main characters of OtterClam’s first adventure game – Ottopia.

By combining both DeFi and NFT elements, we have created a unique, group-adventure game that gives your Genesis Collection Otto NFTs even more utility. By owning an Otto NFT from the Genesis Collection, you’re eligible to play Ottopia. Your Otto, Cleo, or Lottie will also act as your personal governance token, which allows you to vote on any Otto-related proposals submitted in the Otter DAO.
