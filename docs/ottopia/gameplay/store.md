## Ottopia Market (WIP) <a href="#ottopia-market" id="ottopia-market"></a>

In the short future, the Ottopia DAO is also planning to develop a marketplace for the user to buy and sell various items, even without playing Ottopia. Perhaps you were lucky enough to score a super rare trait on your first mint. You could sell your item at a premium in the market, or you could greatly improve your odds of winning a mission by equipping powerful items. We expect this market to develop a life of its own as the ecosystem begins to flourish.
