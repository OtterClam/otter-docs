## Ottopia Store <a href="#ottopia-store" id="ottopia-store"></a>
The Otter Kingdom has its own Ottopia Store. Here, you can find shell chests to enhance your Otto. You will need CLAM to acquire these items. The revenue generated by the Ottopia Store will also be distributed to the reward pool of the Otter Kingdom, the Otter DAO, and the burn pool (details below).

## Shell Chest <a href="#shell-chest" id="shell-chest"></a>
Shell Chests can be purchased by visiting the Ottopia Store. There are 3 types of Shell Chests available, each containing wearable item. Your chances of finding higher rarity item or more powerful wearable items increases with higher level Shell Chests!

### Why should I buy Shell Chests?

By puchasing the Shell Chest, you will get the wearable item that you can equip on your Otto NFT to increase the attribute values or boost up its rarity score.


### What does a Shell Chest contain?

Every Shell Chest contains **1 wearable item**. Please visit [Items page](./traits#wearable-item) to learn more about wearable items.

Here is the formula used to show the probability of finding different rarity equipment in each chest.

## Ottopia Market (WIP) <a href="#ottopia-market" id="ottopia-market"></a>

In the short future, the OtterClam DAO is also planning to develop a marketplace for the user to buy and sell various items, even without playing Ottopia. Perhaps you were lucky enough to score a super rare trait on your first mint. You could sell your item at a premium in the market, or you could greatly improve your odds of winning a mission by equipping powerful items. We expect this market to develop a life of its own as the ecosystem begins to flourish.
