## Ottopia Foundry <a href="#ottopia-foundry" id="ottopia-foundry"></a>
The Otter Kingdom has its own Ottopia Foundry. Here, you can melt several items to create a new item with the possibility of getting a higher rarity score or better attributes!

To forge a new item, you'll have to collect all of the necessary items that are required and then re-forge them with the new **$FISH** token.  Recipes will continuously be added and some of them will only be available in the Foundry for a limited amount of time, not only that, but there may even be chances to forge Epic+ items! 

So, Ottopians, make sure you keep an eye on the Foundry so you don't miss out!

## $FISH token

Many of you have noticed the new "fish" token that made appearances in a few of the alpha screenshots...well now the $FISH token is here! üêü 

## What is $FISH?

The $FISH token can only be used within the Ottopia website. This token will be used on features like the Foundry and potentially some future games!
