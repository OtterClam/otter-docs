# Foundry

## Ottopia Foundry <a href="#ottopia-foundry" id="ottopia-foundry"></a>
The Otter Kingdom has its own Ottopia Foundry. Here, you can melt several items to create a new item with the possibility of getting a higher rarity score or better attributes!

To forge a new item, you'll have to collect all of the necessary items that are required and then re-forge them with the new **$FISH** token.  Recipes will continuously be added and some of them will only be available in the Foundry for a limited amount of time, not only that, but there may even be chances to forge Epic+ items! 

So, Ottopians, make sure you keep an eye on the Foundry so you don't miss out!

## $FISH token

Many of you have noticed the new "fish" token that made appearances in a few of the alpha screenshots...well now the $FISH token is here! üêü 

## What is $FISH?

The $FISH token can only be used within the Ottopia website. This token will be used on features like the Foundry and potentially some future games!

As part of the Rarity Competition S2 2nd epoch, every Otto NFT will be receiving some gardening supplies. You will randomly get 1 of 3 items: Plastic Watering Can - Red, Gardening Tools - Common Trowel, or Houseplant - Common Plastic Pot (S). These items will help you cultivate and grow new plants from the Foundry!

So let‚Äôs get to it, Ottopians! Head on over to the Ottopia Store and deck your NFTs out in your best "Green" + "Plant" gear!

This chart shows the probability of cultivating plants of different rarities with different Seed Sacks:
