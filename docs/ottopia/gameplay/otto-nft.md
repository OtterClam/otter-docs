# Otto NFT

## Meet Otto!
> The First Citizens of the Otter Kingdom

Otto NFT has unique features and will be valued accordingly. This feature of ERC-721 tokens is what differentiates them from ERC-20 tokens, which are equal in terms of value, and therefore identical and interchangeable.

Otto NFT is breedabl, stakeable and loveable! Ottos from the Genesis Collection are not only the cutest otters in the kingdom, they also have exclusive privileges. Wanna know more? Check out more details in this page.

## Types of Otto NFT <a href="#types-of-otto" id="types-of-otto"></a>

### Classic Otto NFT
A general Otto that shares the peace all over the Otter Kingdom.

### Legendary Otto NFT
Legendary Ottos means all of the traits and wearable items of the Otto NFT are pre-selected by the artist of Otterclam - Appppo, which represents that the legendary Otto NFTs are comparatively beautiful and unique, and possibly rarer than the others!. There are only around 250 legendary Otto NFTs, but the exact number is not verified yet. If you have one legendary Otto, then you are blessed by the otterland!

## Otto Traits and Wearable Items

In the Otterverse, you will have a new name, a new body, and even a new lifestyle. Of course, you will also have different strengths and weaknesses in the form of attributes and traits.

Since each NFT from the Otto Genesis Collection will have unique traits and attributes, it will be up to each player to find other players to create a team of Ottos with the best attribute-trait profiles to successfully complete the mission, or to win a personal challenge with the Otto's strength.

To learn more about the traits and wearable items, please visit: [Traits page](./traits).

## Otto Attributes

Attributes represent the ability of each Otto, Cleo, and Lottie NFT. What are attributes for? Attributes are used to assist in completing missions to find Ottopia. Each mission has its own attributes requirements.

To learn more about the attributes, please visit: [Attributes page](./attributes).

## Otto Rarity Scores

The rarity score is calculated according to the traits each Otto possesses. Each trait has its own base rarity score and relative rarity score.
