# Leaderboard

A portion of the revenue generated by the Otto NFT ecosystem will go to the reward pool of the leaderboard! Each Otto has its own unique traits and the Ottos with the most unique traits will be rewarded. 

Once the first Genesis Otto enters the Otterverse through the portal, the leaderboard will show up along with the rarity score. CLAMs will be distributed in the reward pool to the top 50% of Ottos based on different categories from each leaderboard. 

The first category of farming will be: **Rarity score leaderboard**. 

The experience and attributes leaderboard will be introduced in future phase.

## Rarity Leaderboard

### Introduction

Inspired by Aavegotchi, Otter King also develop a unique rarity farming system. It strives to reward the users who are the most thoughtfully and enthusiastically engaged with the ecosystem. As its name suggests, this is a process where you attempt to raise the rarest Otto, Lottie or Cleo, and get rewarded for doing so.

This page will explain how you can engage in rarity farming, and how the rarest Otto NFT are determined. Keep reading to learn more!

### How to play

There are several ways you can engage in the rarity farming exercise. These include:

- Carefully selecting your Otto NFT with rare traits during the summoning process (you can post the images on community to ask for suggesitons eventhough the rarity scores are not revealed before summon. This is what makes the summon process fun, right?)
- Equipping wearables to modify the traits of your Otto NFT
 - By now you can purchase [Shell Chests](./store#shell-chest) to get wearable equipment to enhance your Otto NFT!
- Engaging in games and missions

That said, the rarity level of a single Otto NFT is dynamic and will change over time, as the distribution of traits and wearables in the Otterverse changes. In other words, it isn't enough to simply max out a particular trait in your Otto NFT. You also have to consider the actions of other players. For instance, if too many players try to grind it out for a Epic (E3) rifle with high Base Rarity Score (BRS), this trait becomes less rare, and its Relative Rarity Rcore (RRS) decreases, and then your Otto's rarity level will inevitably go down.

### Calculating Rarity

There are 2 types of rarity scores in play here - Base Rarity Score (for traits and wearables) & Absolute Rarity Score. In the [Rarity Score page](./rarity-farming.md), there is more detailed information that you should learn if you'd like to dig deeper in rarity farming.

### Reward system

The OtterClam DAO is still figuring out the reward system for Rarity Leaderboard. Please hold on and get updated on [Discord](https://discord.gg/otterclam).
