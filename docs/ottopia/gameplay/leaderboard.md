The first category of farming will be: **Rarity score leaderboard**. 

## Rarity Leaderboard

### Introduction

Inspired by Aavegotchi, Otter King also develop a unique rarity farming system. It strives to reward the users who are the most thoughtfully and enthusiastically engaged with the ecosystem. As its name suggests, this is a process where you attempt to raise the rarest Otto, Lottie or Cleo, and get rewarded for doing so.

### Rewards

Beginning with Season 4, $MATIC pool rewards will be distributed among the top 10% of participants (previously, Season 1-3 were counted in $CLAM and distributed to the top 50%). Visit the corresponding Raking for Rarity Competition season page for more information about the rewards.

The second category of farming will be: **Adventure points leaderboard**.

## Adventure Leaderboard

### Introduction

Send your Ottos to the adventure and get the **Adventure Points (AP)**. Your accumulated AP for each round determines your ranking on the leaderboard.

The more adventures your Otto NFT completes, the higher its ranking will be. The higher your Otto NFT’s rank is, the more rewards you'll receive – so assess your risk tolerance and embark on your adventure!

### Rewards

A total of 15,000,000 $FISH pool rewards will be distributed among the top 50% of participants for each season. Visit the corresponding Adventure Leaderboard season page for more information about the rewards.
