A portion of the revenue generated by the Otto NFT ecosystem will go to the reward pool of the leaderboard! Each Otto has its own unique traits and the Ottos with the most unique traits and equipped items will be rewarded. 

$CLAM / $FISH and other rewards will be distributed in the reward pool to the top 50% of Ottos based on different categories from each leaderboard.

The first category of farming will be: **Rarity score leaderboard**. 

## Rarity Leaderboard

### Introduction

Inspired by Aavegotchi, Otter King also develop a unique rarity farming system. It strives to reward the users who are the most thoughtfully and enthusiastically engaged with the ecosystem. As its name suggests, this is a process where you attempt to raise the rarest Otto, Lottie or Cleo, and get rewarded for doing so.

The following links are the all seasons that OtterClam has been hosted by now:

The second category of farming will be: **Adventure points leaderboard**.

## Adventure Leaderboard

### Introduction

Send your Ottos to the adventure and get the **Adventure Points (AP)**. Your accumulated AP for each round determines your ranking on the leaderboard.

The more adventures your Otto NFT completes, the higher its ranking will be. The higher your Otto NFT’s rank is, the more rewards you'll receive – so assess your risk tolerance and embark on your adventure!
