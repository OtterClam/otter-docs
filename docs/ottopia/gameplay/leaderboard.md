# Leaderboard

A portion of the revenue generated by the Otto NFT ecosystem will go to the reward pool of the leaderboard! Each Otto has its own unique traits and the Ottos with the most unique traits and equipped items will be rewarded. 

Once the first Genesis Otto enters the Otterverse through the portal, the leaderboard will show up along with the rarity score. CLAMs will be distributed in the reward pool to the top 50% of Ottos based on different categories from each leaderboard. 

The first category of farming will be: **Rarity score leaderboard**. 

The experience and attributes leaderboard will be introduced in future phase.

### Introduction

Inspired by Aavegotchi, Otter King also develop a unique rarity farming system. It strives to reward the users who are the most thoughtfully and enthusiastically engaged with the ecosystem. As its name suggests, this is a process where you attempt to raise the rarest Otto, Lottie or Cleo, and get rewarded for doing so.
