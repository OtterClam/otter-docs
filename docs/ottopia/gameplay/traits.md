Your otterâ€™s traits, including looks, personality, and voice, will determine its attributes. There are 2 types of traits:

- Native Traits
- Wearable Equipment

### Native Traits <a href="#native-traits" id="native-traits"></a>

Native traits are ones your Otto is given at birth. They are extremely difficult to change, but there would be magic potions in the Otterverse that can alter native traits in the future. 

Each Otto NFT has the following Native traits:
- Eyes
- Mouth
- Skin Type
- Skin Color
- Personality
- Voice
- Gender
- Coat of Arms
- Birthday

### Wearable Equipment <a href="#wearable-equipment" id="wearable-equipment"></a>

Wearable equipment is technically a trait, and can be attached to our uniquely designed ERC1155 items using ERC998 specs. 

Each Otto NFT has the following Wearable Equipment traits:
- Background
- Headwear
- Object Holding
- Special Accessories
- Clothes

#### A Note on Equipment:

Although your Otto will be minted with a specific set of equipment (some will have very basic equipment, others will have special, rare equipment), you can acquire additional equipment by purchasing shell chests in the [Ottopia Store](./store). You also have the chance to win rare equipment if your team completes a mission.

As stated above, each piece of equipment is also an ERC1155 token that can be combined with an Otto NFT thanks to ERC998. You can equip or unequip the items anytime you want or trade the equipment in the secondary market. Remember, the attributes of each Otto NFT will be affected by the equipment.
